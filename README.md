  ## Description
  In this assignment we use the industry standard for managing complex state in a large-scale React application. We started this application with a global state using React's Context API. We then refactored it to use Redux. When the user reviews the app's store, they find that the app does indeed use Redux store instead of the Context API. The application uses Redux provider, and reducers to when changing the global state to a Redux store instead of Context API. We also use Redux to extract state data from the store and finally, we use it to dispatch functions.

  ## Installation Instructions
  to begin, we must install packages using 'npm install'. But first, we must make a few adjustments in the package.json so we can actually use Redux. After installing the packages, the user can then run the seed from the database using 'npm run seed'. From there we can use 'npm run develop' to deploy to localhost and view changes as we make them.

  After we are done refactoring, it is time to deploy to heroku.
